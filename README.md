# Computational-Intelligence---Titanic-Project
This project is based on the Kaggle ML competition which requires the building of a model able to classify if a certain person (instance) survived the sinking of the Titanic or not, given a set of features. This work will consist of the comparison between several classification models, concretely a Logistic Regression model and different Artificial Neural Network approaches, using the architecture of a MultiLayer Perceptron. In the first sections of this report, the data used and preprocessing techniques are explained in detail. In later sections, we discuss both approaches to build our Machine Learning classifier, as well as the parameters for each. Finally, we show the obtained results with each model, and choose the best to perform the classification on the test data â€“ the aim of the competition. The final results retrieved from Kaggle after this prediction are shown in the last section of the report. To finish, we expose our most important conclusions from the work performed, and the computational intelligence research field in a wider view. Attached to this report we provide a python notebook with the necessary code to perform all experiments.
